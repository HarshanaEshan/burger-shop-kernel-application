# burger-shop-kernel-application
Welcome to the Burger Shop repository! In the development of kernel software for a burger shop system, we have employed the principles of object-oriented programming. Furthermore, CRUD is used.

The initial phase involves the utilization of an array for data storage. Subsequently, this array is transformed into an object array, leveraging object-oriented programming concepts. Following this, the data structure concepts are employed to further refine the structure into a list array.

This systematic approach ensures an organized and efficient implementation of the burger shop system, aligning with the best practices in software development.
